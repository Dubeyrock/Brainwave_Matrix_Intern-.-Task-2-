## Introduction

This project aims to analyze sentiment expressed in social media posts related to various topics. It leverages natural language processing techniques to preprocess text data, apply sentiment analysis algorithms, and visualize sentiment trends using charts and graphs.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Methods to collect social media data using APIs (e.g., Twitter API) or process existing datasets.
- **Text Preprocessing:** NLP techniques (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization) to clean and prepare text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Algorithms to determine sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) of social media posts.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations of sentiment trends over time, word clouds, and geographical sentiment maps.
- **User Interaction:** Command-line tools or scripts to interact with the sentiment analysis functionalities.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd social-media-sentiment-analysis
Install dependencies:
